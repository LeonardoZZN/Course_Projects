# 📚 Bookshelf Keeper Program

This project provides a simulation of a **Bookshelf system** where books of varying positive heights are maintained in **non-decreasing order**.  
The program is driven by the `BookshelfKeeperProg` class and makes use of `Bookshelf` and `BookshelfKeeper` classes to efficiently handle book operations.

## ✨ Features

- Create a `Bookshelf` with any number of books (positive heights only).  
- Maintain books in **non-decreasing order of height** automatically.  
- Pick a book from the shelf while keeping the order intact.  
- Insert a new book onto the shelf in the correct position.  
- Prevents books from “falling down” by enforcing ordering rules.
