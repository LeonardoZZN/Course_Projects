## üìñ About
The **Bookshelf Keeper Program** simulates a bookshelf system where books of varying positive heights are maintained in **non-decreasing order**.  
It is built around three main classes:  

- `Bookshelf` ‚Üí represents the collection of books.  
- `BookshelfKeeper` ‚Üí manages insertion and removal while maintaining order.  
- `BookshelfKeeperProg` ‚Üí the main driver program for running simulations.  

The program ensures that books remain upright and properly ordered when picked or placed.
