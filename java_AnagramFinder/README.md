## 📖 About
The **Scrabble Word Finder** is a console-based program that generates all legal words from a given rack of English letters, similar to the rules of the game *Scrabble*.  
It allows users to provide a custom dictionary via command-line argument or defaults to the widely used **SOWPODS** Scrabble dictionary if none is specified.  

Words are generated by:  
1. Building a `Rack` object from user input.  
2. Processing the dictionary through an `AnagramDictionary` that groups words by their anagram signatures.  
3. Finding all valid anagrams for subsets of the rack.  
4. Sorting results by **Scrabble score** (using the `ScoreTable` class).  

The program repeatedly prompts users for input and outputs the complete list of legal words in decreasing order of Scrabble scores.

## ✨ Features
- Accepts a rack of English letters and finds all valid Scrabble words.  
- Supports **custom dictionaries** (via command-line argument).  
- Defaults to the official **SOWPODS dictionary** if none is provided.  
- Efficient **anagram grouping** using a HashMap for dictionary preprocessing.  
- Automatically generates all subsets of the rack to maximize word possibilities.  
- Words are sorted:  
  - Alphabetically (for grouping).  
  - By **Scrabble score** in decreasing order.

## ⚙️ Installation
### Prerequisites
- [Java 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)  

### Steps
Clone this repository and compile the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonardoZZN/Course_Projects.git
cd ./java_AnagramFinder/src
javac *.java
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the program with the default dictionary:
`java WordFinder`
Or run with a custom dictionary:
`java WordFinder custom_dictionary.txt`
When the program starts:
- It checks for an optional dictionary argument.
- Prompts the user for rack strings in a loop.
- Prints the list of legal anagrams sorted by Scrabble score.
Example session:
```vbnet
Using dictionary: SOWPODS.txt
Type . to quit.
Rack? train
We can make 48 words from "train"
All of the words with their scores (sorted by score):
7: train
6: rain, rant, tarn
5: art, tin, tan, ant, rat, nit
...
Rack? .
```

## 🔧 Configuration
- Dictionary:
  - Defaults to SOWPODS.txt.
  - Can be overridden with a user-specified file provided as a command-line argument.
- Rack input:
  - Enter strings of letters to form Scrabble racks.
  - Enter . to quit.
